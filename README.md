# Deck-Of-Cards
This is a trivial assignment for a deck of cards written in Java.

The deck is created, populated then shuffled. Methods are available to deal a card, check the remaining cards and inspect the deck as a whole.
A second deck of dealt cards is created as a consequence.


An indexed menu is provided in the main class that makes use of all the provided methods. Only a simple run is needed to test them.
